<h1>Express Notes</h1>
<br />
<div>
  <h3>Introdcution</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Express is a fast(high performance), (not high level, still rpvodes full
      control), minimalist web framework for Node.js
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>"server-side"</b>
      <b>"Backend"</b>
      framework.
    </li>
    <li>
      It is used with React,vue,Angular,..etc. front end framework to create a
      fullstack Webapp .
    </li>
    <li>
      We can built API with Express to take requests from frontend to render
      client side views.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div>
  <h3>Why to use Express ?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Easier to Build in compare to Node.</li>
    <li>minimum codes.</li>
    <li>Express used for API/JSON data,and also for server-rendered apps.</li>
    <li>other less popular Node Frameworks: Koa, happyJS, ...</li>
    <li>Great to use with Client side JS frameworks</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div>
  <h3>Learn before Express</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Basic knowleagde of NodeJS and NPM</li>

    <li>JS fundamentals</li>
    <li>HTTP Status Code</li>
    <li>JSON</li>
    <li>ES6+</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div>
  <h3>Basic Route Handling</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      app.get(),app.post(),app.put(),app.delete() etc are crud routes of
      Express.
    </li>
    <li>
      Express has router so we can store routes in separate files and export
    </li>
    <ul>
      <h4>Handling requests/routes is simple</h4>
      <b>within routes we can</b>
      <span
        ><li>
          //Fetch data from DB
        </li>
        <li>
          //Load pages
        </li>
        //Return JSON
        <li>
          //Full access to request & response
        </li></span
      >
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <h4>About Request and Response</h4>
      <p>
        Request and Response objects are very important. The Request object
        represents the HTTP request properties for things like "Url parameters",
        "Query strings","Any daat that sent in the body","HTTP header", and all
        the stuff is included in request. The Response Object represents HTTP
        response its on use to send back response maybe "JSON data",
        "Template","Redirect", ...etc.
      </p>
    </ul>
    <li>We can parse incoming data with body Parser</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div>
  <h3>Express Middleware</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Middleware functions are functions the have functions that have access to
      request and response object. Express has built in Middleware but it also
      comes from 3rd party packages as well as custom middleware
    </li>
    <li>Excute any code</li>
    <li>Make changes to request/response objects</li>
    <li>End Response cycle</li>
    <li>Call next middleware in the stack</li>
  </ul>
</div>
